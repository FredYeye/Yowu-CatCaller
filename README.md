# Yowu CatCaller
Yowu CatCaller is a program that lets you control the color and mode settings of Yowu headsets* over bluetooth.

*As of right now it can only connect to the Yowu Selkirk 4. Adding support other Yowu headsets should hopefully be simple, if the demand is there.

## Motivation
This came about for two reasons. Simultaneously connecting the headset to a computer and a phone over bluetooth (for audio & changing settings, respectively) introduces severe audio latency (sometimes?). This program hopes to resolve this issue as connecting to a phone is no longer needed.
The second reason is that the Yowu app is frustrating to use (can only listen or change settings but not both at once sometimes, struggles to find the headset, etc).

## Current capabilities
* Set color/brightness
* Set mode
* Set mode parameters (brightness + speed / bpm + duration)

## Planned features / Nice-to-haves
* Save color / mode presets
* Detect other Yowu models
* Ability to receive commands from *The Internet* (twitch bits?)
